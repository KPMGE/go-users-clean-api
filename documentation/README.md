# Api Documentation

### How to generate api docs.
You can easily generate your api docs. First of all, you're supposed to run the following command:

```bash
npx insomnia-documenter --config ./golang-api.json
```

Then, you can run a server with your brand new doc by using:
```bash
npx serve
```

Now it's as simple as opening a new tab on your favourite browser and access the link:
> http://localhost:3000
